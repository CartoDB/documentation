We have released a new feature for [pop-up windows](/carto-user-manual/maps/map-settings/#interactions) in Builder maps. Now users can customize their pop-ups using HTML and a templating system that allows accessing featureâ€™s properties. This kind of flexibility allows users to add dynamic content to their maps, such as: Google Street View images, custom links based on data properties, images, logos, GIFs, etc. Check out this [blogpost](https://carto.com/blog/google-street-view-pop-ups-with-carto/) to see some examples of this feature in action.

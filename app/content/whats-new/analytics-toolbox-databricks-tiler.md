Starting today, our Databricks users have the possibility to generate [spatial index tilesets based on H3](https://docs.carto.com/analytics-toolbox-databricks/reference/tiler/#create_spatial_index_tileset) natively in Databricks. 
</br>

The tiler is a module of our advanced Analytics Toolbox for Databricks that allows to process and visualize very large spatial datasets stored in Databricks. If you are interested in it, please contact with support@carto.com to receive more information about it.

CARTO Workspace now supports [importing geospatial files](../carto-user-manual/data-explorer/importing-data/) through a PostgreSQL connection leveraging [CARTO Import API](https://api-docs.carto.com/#d8fea1d4-2f80-4270-a684-75fd83b10426). 

With this new functionality, CARTO users working with a PostgreSQL database will be able to get their geospatial data ready for advanced analysis and visualization in Builder and [CARTO for deck.gl](../deck-gl/getting-started/).

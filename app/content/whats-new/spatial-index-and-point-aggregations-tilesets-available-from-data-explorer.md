Starting today, it is available to all users the possibility of generating both Spatial Index and Point Aggregation tilesets on their own data tables directly from the Data Explorer UI.
This feature complements the [existing workflow](/carto-user-manual/data-explorer/creating-a-tileset-from-your-data/), with the possibility of generating tilesets of large datasets based on spatial index (H3 and quadbin) and points, by defining aggregations on the interested features. The platform detects automatically if the table is based on spatial indexes or points and provides the new options in the "Create Tileset" wizard.

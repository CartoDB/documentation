You can now synchronize the user groups coming from your Single Sign-On (SSO) directory (e.g. SAML, LDAP, etc.) with CARTO. Thanks to this new feature users can now share maps and connections with those inherited groups. You can access full details in our documentation on [sharing with groups](/carto-user-manual/maps/publishing-and-sharing-maps/#sharing-with-certain-groups) and [group management](https://docs.carto.com/carto-user-manual/settings/managing-user-groups/).

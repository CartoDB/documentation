We have introduced a new design in the [Data Explorer](/carto-user-manual/data-explorer/introduction/) that brings a good amount of improvements for our users: it allows to search and sort data objects within connections, provides pagination and infinite scrolling for connections with access to thousands of tables, facilitates access to Data Observatory subscriptions, includes shortcuts for creating new connections and importing data, etc.

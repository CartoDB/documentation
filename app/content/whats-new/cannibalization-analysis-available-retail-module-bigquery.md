Retailers working with Google BigQuery and CARTO can now analyze the potential cannibalization cased by a set of new stores into their existing networks, based on the overlap of the different trade areas in terms of geographic area but also in terms of any other spatial feature that the user wants to use in the analysis (e.g. population, number of households). Check out [our documentation](/analytics-toolbox-bigquery/sql-reference/retail/#cannibalization_overlap) and [this example](/analytics-toolbox-bigquery/examples/store-cannibalization/) to learn more about how to run this analysis with our [Analytics Toolbox for BigQuery](/analytics-toolbox-bigquery/overview/getting-started/).

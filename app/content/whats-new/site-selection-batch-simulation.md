Batch simulation of candidate locations is now possible in the Site Selection application. Instead of simulating locations one by one, users can now use a CSV template to upload in bulk the location details of their candidates. They can subsequently edit and remove their locations in the application as they see fit before running a batch simulation.

This feature enables users to process in bulk lists of candidate locations often provided by separate research teams, rather than one by one.

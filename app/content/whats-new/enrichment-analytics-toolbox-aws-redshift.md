Users can now enrich their data tables in Amazon Redshift with features from both their Data Observatory subscriptions and from their other 1st party data tables.

Procedures for Data Enrichment are now included in the Data module of the Analytics Toolbox for Redshift, specific for working with point data, polygons or spatial indexes. Please check out our [documentation](https://docs.carto.com/analytics-toolbox-redshift/sql-reference/data/#data) to find all the details and examples.

As part of an active taskforce to improve our sign up and login processes, we have now released an improved interface for Admin users to [manage invitations](https://docs.carto.com/carto-user-manual/settings/inviting-users-to-your-organization/) to join the CARTO organization and to manage user requests to join it.

We have released in beta a new domain-specific module in the [Analytics Toolbox for BigQuery](/analytics-toolbox-bigquery/overview/getting-started/) to solve advanced geospatial analysis for the CPG / FMCG sector, starting with [customer segmentation](/analytics-toolbox-bigquery/sql-reference/cpg/). We now offer a set of procedures that allow users in that industry to solve this use-case end-to-end, from the generation of trade areas to running multiple segmentation scenarios of merchants based on a customisable set of spatial features. In this [recent blogpost](https://carto.com/blog/trade-area-analysis-cpg-merchants/) we showcase how to use these analytical routines with a specific example.

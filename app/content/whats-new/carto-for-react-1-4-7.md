A new version of [CARTO for React](https://docs.carto.com/react/overview/) has been released with the following main highlights:

- Support for parameterized queries. Now, a user can define queries that allow for external parameters to be injected into the query and create more powerful dynamic queries without having to modify the SQL; this, will result in filtering being applied from the backend side to the sources and will be reflected in layers and widgets. For more information, a guide has been included in our documentation and can be accessed [here]( https://docs.carto.com/react/guides/query-parameters/).
- Several bug fixes.

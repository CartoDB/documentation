Users working with Spatial Indexes data (Quadbin or H3) in Builder have a couple of new additions that will help them create better and more insightful visualizations:

* The possibility of adjusting the aggregation resolution for a finer control over the aggregation.
* Aggregation operations for categories: `MODE` to get the most frequent category in the aggregated cells; `ANY VALUE` to get _any_ of the aggregated categories.

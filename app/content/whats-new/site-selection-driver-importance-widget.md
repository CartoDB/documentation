Users can now explore the impact of the revenue prediction model features directly through the Site Selection application. 

For each simulated location and associated predicted revenue, the widget showcases the magnitude of the impact of the features included in the model (i.e. population, mobility, POIs, etc.), as well as whether they contribute to predictions positively or negatively.

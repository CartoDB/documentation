Now users can include [custom icons as markers](https://docs.carto.com/carto-user-manual/maps/map-styles/#custom-marker) for point data in Builder maps.This feature includes two differents ways of selecting an icon:

* Using one from our preset collection; based on the well-known Maki icon library, which is designed for cartography purposes;
* Uploading a custom icon in .png or .svg formats. 

Different markers can also be defined by the values of a categorical column, and can even be rotated based on a numeric value; which enables different use-cases such as rotating an arrow based on azimuth for telecommunication antennas or the wind direction in weather maps.

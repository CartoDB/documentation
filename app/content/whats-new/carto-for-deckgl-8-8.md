We are really happy to announce a new release of “CARTO for deck.gl” to allow developers to build even more awesome apps and map visualizations with the CARTO platform. This new release comes from:

- Support in the CartoLayer for datasets using spatial indexes such as H3 and Quadbin. You can now build visualizations with very large datasets without the need of geometry data at an incredible performance and reduced costs.
- You can now leverage our Dynamic Tiling system with SQL Queries, providing great scaling capabilities to your maps.
- deck.gl code base is now migrated to TypeScript. This improves the robustness and maintainability of TypeScript apps using deck.gl as well as the deck.gl codebase itself.

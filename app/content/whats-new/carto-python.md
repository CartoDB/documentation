CARTO now provides a set of [Python packages](http://docs.carto.com/carto-python/overview/) to allow data scientists to work with our platform from within Python notebooks. These packages allow users to work with geospatial data in a fully cloud native way without having to leave their Python environment, and taking advantage of all the potential that [Analytics Toolbox](https://docs.carto.com/analytics-toolbox/about-the-analytics-toolbox/) provides to execute advanced spatial analytics in [Spatial SQL](https://carto.com/spatial-sql/) natively within the leading cloud data warehouse platforms.

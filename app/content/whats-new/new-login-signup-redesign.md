Continuing our efforts to improve our sign up and login processes, we're now launching a new experience.
Users should be able to join CARTO in a more smooth way with these new additions:

- A screen now will offer users the chance to create a new organization or join an existing one if there are users from the same domain
- The list of organizations to join now has details about the users, the plan and a search bar to find the desired organization
- When you [request to join](/carto-user-manual/overview/getting-started/#joining-an-existing-organization) an organization you can now cancel that request (if it was undesired or the admin is unresponsive)
- When following an invitation the signup form will now be already pre-filled
- The process to join an organization is now simpler with less steps
- Multiple bug fixes and minor improvements

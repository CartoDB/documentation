Today we are making available under private beta the option for Admin users to install the Analytics Toolbox in their Snowflake accounts with a simplified process assisted by the CARTO UI.  

From the Settings section of the CARTO Workspace users can now install, update and uninstall the [Analytics Toolbox for Snowflake](https://docs.carto.com/analytics-toolbox-snowflake/overview/getting-started/) without external support. All details for setting up your Snowflake resources and to carry out the installation process can be found in [our documentation](http://docs.carto.com/analytics-toolbox-snowflake/overview/getting-access/#assisted-installation-from-the-carto-workspace).

If you would like to get access to this new feature while in private beta,  please contact CARTOâ€™s support team at support@carto.com.

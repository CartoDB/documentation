Customers relying on [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) for their geospatial data will now be able to create and execute analyses directly from Builder. 

These analyses are created as dynamically generated SQL queries that are pushed down to a PostgreSQL database through a [CARTO connection](../carto-user-manual/connections/creating-a-connection/#connection-to-postgresql). 

The result can be visualized, used as input for another step of the analysis, or persisted into a new table.

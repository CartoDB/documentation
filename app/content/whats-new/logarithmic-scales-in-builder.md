Logarithmic scales are now available as a data classification option in Builder. 

While they're available for all kind of sources, a logarithmic scales based on powers of `10` will be the default option for [aggregated data sources](/carto-user-manual/maps/data-sources/#aggregated-grids).

This new addition will make it easier to create better cartography when working with spatial indexes, as well as a handy additional method of classification for other types of maps.

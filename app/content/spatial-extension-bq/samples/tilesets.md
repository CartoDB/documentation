## Tilesets

### OSM buildings (aggregation)

We want are going to create a Point Aggregation Tileset to visualise all the features tagged as â€˜building' in the OSM BigQuery Dataset. Since this dataset has different types of geometries for the buildings, we are going to use `ST_CENTROID` to ensure they all are points.

The extra column, `aggregated_total`, is adding a count of the number of buildings that are aggregated into a cell, which in this case are quadkeys made of `z + resolution` tiles, that is, each tile will be subdivided into 4^7 (16384) cells.

```sql
CALL bqcarto.tiler.CREATE_POINT_AGGREGATION_TILESET(
  R'''(
        SELECT
            ST_CENTROID(geometry) as geom
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.geo_openstreetmap.planet_features`
        WHERE 'building' IN (SELECT key FROM UNNEST(all_tags)) AND
               geometry IS NOT NULL
    )''',
  '`your-project.your-dataset.osm_buildings_14_7`',
  R'''
    {
      "zoom_min": 0,
      "zoom_max": 14,
      "aggregation_type": "quadkey",
      "aggregation_resolution": 7,
      "aggregation_placement": "cell-centroid",
      "properties":{
        "aggregated_total": {
          "formula":"count(*)",
          "type":"Number"
        }
      }
    }
  ''');
  ```

This process will take the over 300M buildings in the source table, aggregate them into cells and generate a table containing more than 4M tiles around the world.

### New York City trees (aggregation)

In this case we want to visualize an aggregation of the tree census of NYC. Since the table doesn't have a geography column, we are going to create it on the fly using the latitude and longitude columns.

We also want to have access to the status and health of each aggregated cell, so we add some extra properties around that. Finally, as it is a more localized dataset, we want to generate higher zoom levels (16) and when we see individual points we want access to both their official id and their address.

```sql
CALL bqcarto.tiler.CREATE_POINT_AGGREGATION_TILESET(
  R'''(
        SELECT
            ST_GEOGPOINT(longitude, latitude) as geom,
            status, health, tree_id, address
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_trees.tree_census_2015`
    )''',
  '`your-project.your-dataset.test_tilesets.nyc_trees_16_7`',
  R'''
    {
      "zoom_max": 16,
      "aggregation_type": "quadkey",
      "aggregation_resolution": 7,
      "aggregation_placement": "features-centroid",
      "properties":{
        "aggregated_total": {
          "formula": "count(status)",
          "type": "Number"
        },
        "alive_total": {
          "formula": "countif(status = 'Alive')",
          "type": "Number"
        },
        "ok_health": {
          "formula": "countif(health = 'Good' OR health = 'Fair')",
          "type": "Number"        
        }
      },
      "single_point_properties": {
           "tree_id": "Number",
           "address": "String"
      }
    }
  ''');
```

Then we can style our visualization using the properties that we have added:

### 2020 world population (aggregation)

For this example we are going to use a [dataset from CARTO's public Data Observatory](https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/browser/dataset/wp_population_172b5dfd) to visualize the 2020 world population. We are going to use the already aggregated 1km * 1km grid cells:

```sql
CALL bqcarto.tiler.CREATE_POINT_AGGREGATION_TILESET(
  R'''(
        SELECT ST_Centroid(b.geom) as geom, population
        FROM
          `carto-do-public-data.worldpop.demographics_population_glo_grid1km_v1_yearly_2020` a
        INNER JOIN
          `carto-do-public-data.worldpop.geography_glo_grid1km_v1` b
        ON (a.geoid = b.geoid)
    )''',
  '`your-project.your-dataset.wpop_2020_1km_cell`',
  R'''
    {
      "zoom_max": 6,
      "aggregation_type": "quadkey",
      "aggregation_resolution": 7,
      "aggregation_placement": "cell",
      "columns":{
        "population": {
          "formula": "sum(population)",
          "type": "Number"
        }
      }
    }
  ''');
  ```

  Note that since this dataset contains already aggregated data, it doesn't make sense to visualize it at very high zoom levels, but visualize the data at country scale.

### World's road network (lines)

We are going to use a [dataset from CARTO's public Data Observatory](https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/browser/geography/ne_roads_9ff89987) to visualize the world's road netowork. We are going to use the already aggregated 1km * 1km grids cells:

```sql
CALL bqcarto.tiler.CREATE_SIMPLE_TILESET(
  R'''
(
  SELECT geom, type
  FROM `carto-do-public-data.natural_earth.geography_glo_roads_410`
) _input
  ''',
  R'''`cartobq.maps.natural_earth_roads`''',
  R'''
  {
      "zoom_min": 0,
      "zoom_max": 10,
      "max_tile_size_kb": 3072,
      "properties":{
          "type": "String"
       }
  }'''
);
```

The result is a worldwide map with the requested tiles, including the type of each road.

### US block groups (polygons)

We are going to use a [dataset from CARTO's public Data Observatory](https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/browser/dataset/acs_sociodemogr_95c726f9) to visualize the block groups of the US including its population.

```sql
CALL bqcarto.tiler.CREATE_SIMPLE_TILESET(
  R'''
(
  SELECT
    d.geoid,
    d.total_pop,
    g.geom 
  FROM `carto-do-public-data.usa_acs.demographics_sociodemographics_usa_blockgroup_2015_5yrs_20142018` d
  JOIN `carto-do-public-data.carto.geography_usa_blockgroup_2015` g
    ON d.geoid = g.geoid
) _input
  ''',
  R'''`cartobq.maps.blockgroup_pop`''',
  R'''
  {
      "zoom_min": 0,
      "zoom_max": 14,
      "max_tile_size_kb": 3072,
      "properties":{
          "geoid": "String",
          "total_pop": "Number"
       }
  }'''
);
```

## Introduction
The CARTO 3 Tokens API allows to create public tokens that grant access to specific tables, tilests and arbitraty queries using a specific connection in your CARTO 3 account. Learn more about connections [here](https://docs.carto.com/carto3-workspace/connections/introduction/).
A public token allows to create map layers and fetch data from tables, tilesets or arbitrary SQL queries in public applications.

## Getting access

You can get access to the Analytics Toolbox for Snowflake through the [Snowflake's Data Marketplace](https://www.snowflake.com/datasets/carto-spatial-extension/). If you are unsure of how to access the Data Marketplace, you can find detailed instructions in [this article](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-marketplace-intro.html#how-do-i-access-the-snowflake-data-marketplace-to-browse-listings) of Snowflake's documentation center.

Once in the Data Marketplace, search for _carto analytics toolbox_ to find the listing:

Once you are in the details page of the listing, you may find you can _GET_ the Analytics Toolbox directly, or _REQUEST_ it, depending on whether or not it has been already deployed in your region.


### Requesting access

1. Click on the REQUEST button on the top right corner of the Data Marketplace listing.

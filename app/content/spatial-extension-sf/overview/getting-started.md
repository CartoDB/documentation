## Getting started

The CARTO Spatial Extension for Snowflake is composed of a set of user-defined functions and procedures organized in a set of modules based on the functionality they offer. There are two types of modules: _core_ modules, that are [open source](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-spatial-extension) and free to use for anyone with a Snowflake account, and _advanced_ modules, only available with a CARTO account. 

Visit the [SQL Reference](../../sql-reference/) to see the full list of available modules and functions.

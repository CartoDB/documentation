When a user initiates the account creation process, they can choose to create a new account, or join an existing account. Creating a new account is a 'one-off process' / single/one step process, while joining an existing account needs the approval of the account administrator.

Select the checkbox if you want someone with the same email domain to automatically join your account, or leave it unchecked if you want them to go through an approval process to be able to join your account.

### Approving request 

From the *User* section, you will easily identify the users who have asked to join your account. You can identify them by an hand icon and a popup stating 'Join request'. You can access the quick actions menu for managing users request by clicking on the drop-down menu, or by clicking the three point icon in the right corner. There are two options available: Accept Request or Decline it.

## Configuring your account

The Carto 3 Workspace includes options for configuring your account. From the *Account Settings* menu, you can rename your account name, manage who can join your account, view the details of your account plan, register existing apps, invite users to join your account and delete your account.

### Renaming your account 

From the *General* section, you can rename your account name or manage who can join your account:

![Account Settings rename acocunt](/img/cloud-native-workspace/account-settings/account_settings_general.png)

Click *Rename* to edit your account name, or click Cancel if you donâ€™t want the changes to be applied.

### Managing who can join your account

From the *General* section, you can rename your account name or manage who can join your account:

![Account Settings rename acocunt](/img/cloud-native-workspace/account-settings/account_settings_general.png)

When a user initiates the account creation process, they can choose to create a new account, or join an existing account. Creating a new account is a 'one-off process' / single/one step process, while joining an existing account needs the approval of the account administrator.

Select the checkbox if you want someone with the same email domain to automatically join your account, or leave it unchecked if you want them to go through an approval process to be able to join your account.

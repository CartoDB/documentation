## Delete account

Carto 3 Workspace includes the option for deleting user accounts. From the *Users* section, you will see the list of users who have access to your account. You can access the quick actions menu for deleting a user by clicking the three point icon in the right corner. There is only 1 option available: Delete user.

(IMAGEN 'USER' SECTION - ACTIONS)

If you click the Delete quick action, a dialog will appear so you can confirm that you want to delete the user. Click the *Yes, delete* button to confirm the changes or click Cancel if you donâ€™t want the changes to be applied.

## Add source

The *Layers* tab appear, where you can upload new datasets using a local file or add a dataset from your existing data warehouse connection. If you havenâ€™t added a data source yet, you will see the following page:

### ADD SOURCE FROM A CONNECTION

From the *Layers* tab, go to *Sources* panel and click on *Add source from...*. A new dialog will open so you can select a table or a tileset from your selected connection. Insert the *Fully Qualified Table* or the *Tileset Name* and click *Add source*.

Once the process is finished, the BigQuery table is included in the Builder map tool as a new layer. The map displays the basemap and map layer that are the backbone for rendering your visualization. You can add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features.

### ADD SOURCE FROM A CUSTOM QUERY

Go to *Sources* and click *Add source from...*. A new dialog will open so you can create your own query or run a SQL analysis from your connection. Select an option and click *Add source*.

![Enter table name](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_analysis_query.png)

Once the process is finished, the SQL console is included in the Builder map view. You can type your query by inserting the *Fully Qualified Table* or the *Tileset Name* and then click *Run*.

In this example we are going to use a table with BigQuery connection. The BigQuery table is included in the Builder map tool as a new layer. The map displays the basemap and map layer that are the backbone for rendering your visualization. You can add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features.

### ADD SOURCE FROM A LOCAL FILE

Go to *Sources* and click *Add source from...*. A new dialog will open so you can upload a CSV, Json, GeoJSON or saved map Json file. You can browse your files, or drag & drop them into the dotted area of the dialog.

Once data is imported, the dataset is included in the Builder map tool as a new layer. The map displays the basemap and map layer that are the backbone for rendering your visualization. You can add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features.

In all cases, you can keep adding multiple data to your map from your different data sources.

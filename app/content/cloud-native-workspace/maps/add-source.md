### ADD SOURCE FROM A CONNECTION

Once the process is finished, the BigQuery table is included in the Builder map tool as a new layer. The map displays the basemap and map layer that are the backbone for rendering your visualization. You can add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features.

The CARTO 3 Builder contains many features that guide you through the process of creating a map, changing the styling, and selecting how your data appears. Use the following task list as guide for some of the main CARTO 3 Builder features:

- Add your source [guide](../../maps/add-data)
- View your data table [guide](../../maps/view-data-table)
- Configure your map settings [guide](../../maps/map-settings)
- Style your maps [guide](../../maps/map-styles)

### ADD SOURCE FROM A CUSTOM QUERY

## Editing a connection

In the *Connections* menu of the Workspace, you will see the list of your current connections. You can access the quick actions menu for managing your connection by clicking on the three point icon in the top right corner. There are 2 options available: Edit connection and Delete connection.

If you click the *Edit* quick action, you will be redirected to a dialog for editing connection parameters. This dialog contains the same form that you filled out when adding the connection, showing the current values.

If you edit the connection parameters and you have datasets that are syncing at periodic intervals, these datasets will no longer sync if they are not available using the modified connection parameters.

After editing the connection parameters click the *Save changes* button. A dialog will appear so you can confirm that you want to save the changes. It includes information about maps related to the existing connection that could potentially be affected by the change. Click the *Yes, save* button to confirm the changes or click *Cancel* if you don't want the changes to be applied.

## Accessing aplications

The CARTO 3 Workspace allows you to have all your applications centralised so that you can access them quickly and easily.

In the *Applications* menu of the Workspace, you will see the list of all your current applications. This list can include existing applications that you are interested in having registered, or new built applications.

This menu will only be visible when you have at least one application registered or created. Every time an application is registered or created, it will be appear on this list. Likewise, when an application is deleted, it will disappear from the list.

The following screen shows the *Applications* menu with the list of all current applications identified by an image, the name and the last update performed. You can access them by clicking on each banner.

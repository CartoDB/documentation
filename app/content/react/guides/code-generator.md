## Code Generator

We use [Hygen](https://www.hygen.io/) to generate the code of the most common operations.

Create a new View:

```bash
yarn hygen view new
```

Create a new Source:

```bash
yarn hygen source new
```

Create a new Layer (and attach to the previous Source, and optionally previous View):

```bash
yarn hygen layer new
```

For further information:

```bash
yarn hygen help
```

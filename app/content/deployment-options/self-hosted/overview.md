## Overview

CARTO can be deployed in your own cloud, which means that all [APIs](https://api-docs.carto.com) and [web applications](https://docs.carto.com/carto-user-manual) will be hosted in your own cloud infrastructure. 

CARTO can connect to your cloud data warehouses within your secured network environments to analyze your geospatial data and create maps without compromising security or data governance standards and regulations.

### Options

CARTO Self Hosted is available in two different flavours, to match different levels of complexity and requirements: 

#### Docker Compose

With this option, CARTO is deployed in a single VM using Docker Compose. This deployment is the easiest and fastest, and will work well for most use cases.

#### Kubernetes

Using Kubernetes, CARTO can satisfy the most demanding scenarios and requirements. This option puts the focus on scalability and high-availability

## Overview

Deck.gl is one of the most popular Open Source map visualization libraries and is the preferred library to use with CARTO. With deck.gl and CARTO you can create highly scalable applications that visualize location data in many different ways. Since version 8.3, deck.gl includes a submodule @deck.gl/carto that you can use to work with CARTO datasets and tilesets in a very easy and straightforward way.

To understand how to install the library and run the examples, [read the guide](../guides/getting-started/).

You can learn more about deck.gl on the official [website](https://deck.gl), where you can find a dedicated section on the @deck.gl/carto [submodule](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/carto/overview).

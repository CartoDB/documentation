## Overview

The Data Observatory is a spatial data platform that enables you to augment your data with the latest and greatest in spatial data. With a [catalog](https://carto.com/data) of thousands of spatial datasets from public and premium sources that have been vetted by our Data team, the Data Observatory provides a streamlined process to reduce the operational inefficiencies of discovering, licensing and accessing spatial data.

### Getting started

We recommend going through the [Terminology](../terminology) section to get familiar with all the components of the Data Observatory and then using our Guides to get started:

* [Accessing and browsing the Spatial Data Catalog](../../guides/accessing-and-browsing-the-spatial-data-catalog).

* [Subscribing to public and premium datasets](../../guides/subscribing-to-public-and-premium-datasets).

* [Managing your subscriptions](../../guides/managing-your-subscriptions).

* [Accessing your subscriptions from BigQuery, AWS or Azure](../../guides/accessing-your-subscriptions-from-bigquery-aws-or-azure).

## CARTO Data Warehouse

Every CARTO organization comes with an active data warehouse connection created by default. 

This connection will grant you access to some resources, in terms of storage and computing, in order to get you started with our platform, and also have access to some demo data. It will also enable you to have access to spatial datasets from CARTOâ€™s Data Observatory without the need of connecting your own data warehouse.

### Limits

The CARTO Data Warehouse connection is limited to a certain amount of computing per day. You can find this limit in the `carto_dw` connection's card. 

### Spatial Extension

The CARTO Spatial Extension is enabled by default on the `carto_dw` connection. Check [this reference](https://docs.carto.com/spatial-extension-bq/sql-reference/overview/) to learn about the functions available in the extension.

### CARTO Demo Data

The `carto_dw` connection grants access to a set of demo tables and tilesets that can be used to start creating maps and exploring the tools from the very beginning. They're available and ready to be used in your Data Explorer.

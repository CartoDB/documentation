## Subscribing to public and premium datasets

Using the same Spatial Data Catalog web interface within the dashboard users can instantly subscribe to any of our public datasets and submit requests to start the licensing process of premium datasets from our vetted data sources.

### Public datasets

If the dataset license is public, within the dataset page in the Spatial Data Catalog you can click on *"Subscribe for free"* to start the subscription process or click on *"Access free sample"*.

### Premium datasets

For premium dataset, the user can place a subscription request, after which our team of experts will get in touch to help you understand all the details about the dataset to ensure it is the best fit for the use-case and to guarantee a hassle-free subscription process. Once that process is completed, the premium data subscription will be automatically created and you will have access to a ready-to-query and always up-to-date version of the premium dataset of your choice.

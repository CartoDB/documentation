## Deleting your organization

The CARTO 3 Workspace includes the option to delete user organizations. Deleting an organization includes the deletion of all maps, connections, users, and any content created. A text warns you to proceed with caution.

If you click the Delete quick action, a dialog will appear so you can enter your organization name and confirm that you want to delete the user. Click the *Yes, delete* button to confirm the changes or click Cancel if you donâ€™t want the changes to be applied.

## Configuring your organization

CARTO 3 Workspace includes several options for configuring your organization. From the *Settings* menu, you can rename your organization, manage who can join your organization, view the details of your plan, register existing apps and delete your organization.

### Managing your organization

From the *General* section, you can rename your organization or manage who can join to it. Select the checkbox if you want someone with the same email domain to automatically join your organization, or leave it unchecked if you want them to go through an approval process to be able to join your organization:

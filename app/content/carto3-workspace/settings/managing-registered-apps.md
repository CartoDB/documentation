## Managing registered apps

The CARTO Workspace includes the option to manage your registered apps. From the *Settings* section, you can register, edit, view details about, and delete apps.

### Registering apps

You can register existing apps so that you have quick and easy access to them when required. To register an app, click the *Register new* button.

Once the application is registered, you can access it directly by clicking on the link below the name of the application.

### Editing apps

Once you have registered your app, you will see the list of your current registered apps. You can access the quick actions menu to manage your app by clicking the three point icon in the top right hand corner. There are 3 options available: Edit, View details, and Delete.

If you click the Edit quick action, you will be redirected to a dialog for editing registration parameters. This dialog contains the same form that you filled out when registing the app, showing the current values.

After editing the registration parameters click the *Save* button. A popup will appear informing you that the app has been successfully registered. Otherwise, click *Cancel* if you don’t want the changes to be applied.

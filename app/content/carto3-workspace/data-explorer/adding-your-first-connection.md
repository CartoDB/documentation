## Adding your first connection

For adding your first connection, follow the next steps:

1. Click on *Create your first connection*. It will be switched to the *Connections* section. 
2. From the *Connections* sections, select your data warehouse: BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Redshift, Snowflake, etc.
2. Click the *Setup connection* button, or the *Connect using a service account* button if you are connecting to BigQuery.
3. Enter the connection parameters and credentials. You need to enter the connection parameters such as the server, username, password, or provide a service account, depending on the connector.

The following screen shows the connection setup options for BigQuery:

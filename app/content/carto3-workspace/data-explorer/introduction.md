## Introduction

The CARTO 3 Workspace provides an improved and easier experience to help the user build maps and solutions using their geospatial data.

The *Data Explorer* section in the Workspace allows users to explore their data warehouse(s) and data observatory subscriptions as well as creating maps from their data.

From the Data Warehouses panel, select a connection to view content (database/project(s), schemas/datasets, and tables) from top to bottom in a collapsible tree. If you haven’t registered a connection yet, you will see the following page:

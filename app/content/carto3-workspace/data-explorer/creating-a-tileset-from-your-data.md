## Creating a tileset from your data

To create a tileset from your data, select a connection and click on a specific content (database/project(s), schemas/datasets and tables) from the collapsible tree. Once your table or tileset is selected, you can view a preview of the map and the details of the table or tileset. You can create a tileset by clicking on the *Create tileset* button on the top.

A new dialog will open so you can edit your output table. You can create a tileset with the default parameters, or a new tileset that includes advanced options for editing parameters.

Once you click on *Run*, the tileset creation process can be followed from a new dialogue box that appears in the top right corner. There are three possible states: creating tileset, tileset created successfully or tileset creation error. When an error occurs, you can click on *Read more* to get more information about the error.

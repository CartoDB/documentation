## Creating a map from your data

To create a map from your data, select a connection and click on a specific content (database/project(s), schemas/datasets and tables) from the collapsible tree.

Once your table or tileset is selected, you can view a preview of the map and the details of the table or tileset. You can create a map by clicking on the *Create map* button on the top. This will open the CARTO 3 map tool: Builder.

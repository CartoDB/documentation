2. **Organization setup**

    When a user initiates the organization creation process, CARTO 3 will detect if their organization email is already associated with an existing organization. If so, the user can choose to create a new organization or join an existing organization. When joining an existing organization, there are two options available: join the organization directly (if the admin allows through a specific setting) or request access and wait for the admin to approve.

### Quick guide to connect data and create maps

#### Introduction

This is a quick guide to help you get started and is a step-by-step overview on how to connect to your data warehouse, explore your data, and create maps using it.

The CARTO 3 Workspace includes functionalities for registering and managing connections to your data warehouse(s). For each user we provision a CARTO data warehouse, allowing the user to expand the capacity of that connection or connect their own data warehouse(s). 

Once you have registered a connection, you can perform a multitude of operations with the data source, such as executing the functions provided by the CARTO Spatial Extension or creating stunning maps.

#### Create a Connection

Go to the *Connections* menu in the Workspace, where you can view the list of your current connections. If you haven’t registered a connection yet, you will see the following page:

![Connections module](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_connections_module3.png)

To add a new connection, click on *New connection* and follow these steps:

1. Select your data warehouse: BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Redshift, or Snowflake.
2. Click the *Setup connection* button, or the *Connect using a service account* button if you are connecting to BigQuery.
3. Enter the connection parameters and credentials. You need to enter the connection parameters such as the server, username, password, or provide a service account, depending on the connector.

The following screen shows the connection setup options for BigQuery:

![Connection setup with BigQuery](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_connections_bigquery_the_parameters2.png)

After you have provided the connection parameters, click the *Connect* button. Then you will see the list of your current connections:

![Successful connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_connections_successful2.png)

#### Create a Map

The *Maps* page enables you to create and manage maps in the CARTO 3 Workspace. You can use existing connections to your data warehouse(s) or you can directly upload new datasets files.

1. From your *Maps* page, click *Create your first map*. This will open the CARTO 3 map tool: Builder.
	
![Map module](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_map_module.png)

2. The *Layers* tab appear, where you can upload new datasets using a local file or add a dataset from your existing data warehouse connection. In this example, we are using the BigQuery connection created in the previous step. With BigQuery we can use a Query to retrieve data, add a whole Table, or a Tileset.

![Add data to your map](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_layers_no_source.png)
		
3. A new dialog will open so you can select your data source. 

4. In this example we are going to use a table with a BigQuery connection. Insert the *Fully Qualified Table* and click *Add source*.

![Enter table name](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/map_add_source_table.png)

Once the process is finished, the BigQuery table is included in the Builder map tool as a new layer. The map displays the basemap and map layer that are the backbone for rendering your visualization. You can add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features.
	
![Map created](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_style_connection.png)

The CARTO 3 Builder contains many features that guide you through the process of creating a map, changing the styling, and selecting how your data appears. Use the following task list as guide for some of the main CARTO 3 Builder features:

- Add your source [guide](../../maps/add-source)
- View your data table [guide](../../maps/view-data-table)
- Configure your map settings [guide](../../maps/map-settings)
- Style your maps [guide](../../maps/map-styles)

#### Explore your data

The new *Data Explorer* functionality simplifies visualization. This section enables you to explore your connected data warehouse, preview your geospatial tables and tilesets, and create maps or tilesets from your data. If you haven’t connect your own data warehouse yet, you will see the provisioned data warehouse:

![Data Explorer first connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/data_explorer_first_connection2.png)

To add your first connection, you can follow the previous create a connection <a href="#create-a-connection" target="_blank">Guide</a>.

Once you have added a connection, go back to the *Data Explorer* section in the Workspace, where you will see the list of your current connections. If you have registered a connection, you will see the following page:

![Data Explorer first connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/data_explorer_bigquery2.png)

Select a connection and view the content (database/project(s), schemas/datasets, and tables) in a collapsible tree:

![Data Explorer first connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/data_explorer_content.png)

Once your table or tileset is selected, you can view a preview of the map and the details of the table or tileset. You can create a map by clicking on the Create button on the top and then Create map. This will open the CARTO 3 map tool: Builder. In case of large amounts of data, the user will be notified of the possibility to create a map with a dataset added as SQL query with a filter, or to create a tileset to visualize the whole table. 

![Data Explorer first connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/data_explorer_preview.png)

#### Create Tileset

You can create a tileset by clicking on the Create button on the top and then Create tileset. A new dialog will open so you can edit your output table. You can create a tileset with the default parameters, or a new tileset that includes advanced options for editing parameters.

![Data Explorer first connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/data_explorer_create_tileset2.png)

![Data Explorer first connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/data_explorer_create_tileset_custom.png)

#### Extend your data

The Data Observatory is a spatial data platform that enables you to augment your data with the latest and greatest in spatial data. With a [catalog](https://carto.com/data) of thousands of spatial datasets from public and premium sources that have been vetted by our Data team, the Data Observatory provides a streamlined process to reduce the operational inefficiencies of discovering, licensing, and accessing spatial data.

#### Add data and style your maps

The CARTO 3 Builder contains many features that guide you through the process of creating a map, changing the styling, and selecting how your data appears. Use the following task list as guide for some of the main CARTO 3 Builder features:

- Add your data [guide](../../maps/add-source)
- View your data table [guide](../../maps/view-data-table)
- Configure your map settings [guide](../../maps/map-settings)
- Style your maps [guide](../../maps/map-styles)

#### Publish and share your map

Once you visualize and publish a map, you can obtain a link to share the map or embed it on a website or blog. CARTO 3 Builder allows you to GET THE LINK to share a link to your map, EMBED IT using HTML code for a blog or website, or USE the map token for the development of applications. For details, see [Publishing and sharing maps](../../maps/publishing-and-sharing-maps).

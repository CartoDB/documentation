### Quick guide to connect data and create maps

#### Introduction

This is a quick guide to help you get started. A step-by-step overview on how to connect to your data warehouse, explore your data and create maps using your data.

The CARTO 3 Workspace includes functionalities for registering and managing connections to your data warehouses. Once you have registered a connection, you can perform different operations with the data source, like executing the functions provided by the CARTO Spatial Extension or creating stunning maps.

#### Create a Connection

Go to the *Connections* menu in the Workspace, where you will see the list of your current connections. If you haven’t registered a connection yet, you will see the following page:

![Connections module](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_connections_module2.png)

For adding a new connection follow the next steps:

1. Select your data warehouse: BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Redshift, Snowflake, etc.
2. Click the *Setup connection* button, or the *Connect using a service account* button if you are connecting to BigQuery.
3. Enter the connection parameters and credentials. You need to enter the connection parameters such as the server, username, password, or provide a service account, depending on the connector.

The following screen shows the connection setup options for BigQuery:

![Connection setup with BigQuery](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_connections_bigquery_the_parameters.png)

After you have provided the connection parameters, click the *Connect* button. Then you will see the list of your current connections:

![Successful connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_connections_successful.png)

#### Create a Map

The *Maps* page enables you to create and manage maps in the CARTO 3 Workspace. You can use existing connections to your data warehouses or you can directly upload new datasets files.

1. From your *Maps* page, click *Create your first map*. This will open the CARTO 3 map tool: Builder.
	
![Map module](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_map_module.png)

2. The *Layers* tab appear, where you can upload new datasets using a local file or add a dataset from your existing data warehouse connection. In this example, we are using the BigQuery connection created in the previous step. With BigQuery we can use a Query to retrieve data, add a whole Table, or a Tileset.

![Add data to your map](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_layers_no_source.png)
		
3. A new dialog will open so you can select your data source. 

4. In this example we are going to use a table with BigQuery connection. Insert the *Fully Qualified Table* and click *Add source*.

![Enter table name](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/map_add_source_table.png)

Once the process is finished, the BigQuery table is included in the Builder map tool as a new layer. The map displays the basemap and map layer that are the backbone for rendering your visualization. You can add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features.
	
![Map created](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_style_connection.png)

The CARTO 3 Builder contains many features that guide you through the process of creating a map, changing the styling, and selecting how your data appears. Use the following task list as guide for some of the main CARTO 3 Builder features:

- Add your source [guide](../../maps/add-data)
- View your data table [guide](../../maps/view-data-table)
- Configure your map settings [guide](../../maps/map-settings)
- Style your maps [guide](../../maps/map-styles)

#### Explore your data

The *Data Explorer* section enables you to explore your data warehouses and create maps from their data. If you haven’t connect a data warehouse yet, you will see the following page:

![Data Explorer first connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/data_explorer_first_connection.png)

For adding your first connection, you can follow the previous create a connection <a href="http://localhost:1313/carto3-workspace/overview/getting-started/#create-a-connection" target="_blank">Guide</a>.

Once you have added a connection, go back to the *Data Explorer* section in the Workspace, where you will see the list of your current connections. If you have registered a connection, you will see the following page:

![Data Explorer first connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/data_explorer_bigquery.png)

Select a connection and see the content (database/project(s), schemas/datasets and tables) in a collapsible tree:

![Data Explorer first connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/data_explorer_content.png)

This section will allow users to explore their data warehouses and create maps from their data. Select a table or tileset and check the details and metadata from the table/tileset preview. For creating a new map, click New map. This will open the CARTO 3 map tool: Builder.

![Data Explorer first connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/data_explorer_preview.png)

To create and style your maps, learn how to:

- Add your data [guide](../../maps/add-data)
- View your data table [guide](../../maps/view-data-table)
- Configure your map settings [guide](../../maps/map-settings)
- Style your maps [guide](../../maps/map-styles)

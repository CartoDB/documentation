## CARTO for developers

The CARTO 3 Workspace has been designed to make the development of web-based spatial applications as easy as possible. To achieve this, the *Developers* section provides a complete set of app development tools that includes APIs, SDKs, development frameworks, and database connectors to simplify the analysis of massive spatial datasets and the development of powerful Location Intelligence applications.

The developer toolkit includes industry-leading visualization, mapping, and application design components, giving developers unparalleled flexibility to create truly beautiful geospatial user experiences for desktop and mobile.

### API Base URL

The API with the base CARTO 3 URL is displayed. You can copy and use it by clicking on the icon on the right.

#### Editing applications

In the *Built applications* section of the Workspace, you will see the list of your currently built applications:

![Developers list applications](/img/cloud-native-workspace/developers/developers_list_applications(new2).png)

You can access the quick actions menu to manafe your built applications by clicking on the three point icon in the top right hand corner. There are 2 options available: Edit and Delete. You can also copy the application ID by hovering your mouse over and clicking on it.

![Developers application actions](/img/cloud-native-workspace/developers/developers_built_applications_actions(new2).png)

If you click the *Edit* quick action, you will be redirected to a dialog to edit application parameters. This dialog contains the same form that you filled out when creating the application, showing the current values.

![Developers edit application](/img/cloud-native-workspace/developers/developers_editing_applications(new).png)

After editing the built application parameters, click the *Save changes* button. A popup will appear informing you that the app has been successfully created. Otherwise, click *Cancel* if you donâ€™t want the changes to be applied.

#### Deleting applications

In the *Built applications* section of the Workspace, you will see the list of your currently built applications:

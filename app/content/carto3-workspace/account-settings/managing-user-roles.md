## Managing user roles

From the *User* section, you can view the list of users who have access to your account. You can access the quick actions menu to manage users role by clicking on the drop-down menu, or by clicking the three point icon in the right hand corner. There are three options available: Make Admin, Make Editor, and Delete account.

### Making Admin

If you click the Make Admin quick action, you are providing “admin” privileges to the user. This enables the option to have more than one administrator per account.

### Making Editor

If you click the Make Editor quick action, you are providing 'write' and 'read' access to the user.

### Making Viewer

If you click the Make Viewer quick action, you are providing 'read-only' access to the user.

### Deleting User

If you click the Delete user quick action, a dialog will appear allowing you to confirm that you want to delete the user. Click the *Yes, delete* button to confirm the changes or click Cancel if you don’t want the changes to be applied.

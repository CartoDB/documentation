## Inviting users to your account 

The CARTO 3 Workspace includes the option for inviting users to your account. From the *Account Settings* menu, you can invite a user, manage the role, or delete a user.

Click *Invite* to invite select users by sending an email. You must also select the user role as Builder (write and read access) or Viewer (read-only access).

The following screen shows the *Invite user* dialog box:

After adding an email address and a user role, click the *Invite* button. A popup will appear informing you that the invitation has been correctly sent. Otherwise, click *Cancel* if you donâ€™t want to sent the invitation.

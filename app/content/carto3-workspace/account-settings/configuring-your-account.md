### Renaming your account

### Managing who can join your account

From the *General* section, you can rename your account name or manage who can join your account. Select the checkbox if you want someone with the same email domain to automatically join your account, or leave it unchecked if you want them to go through an approval process to be able to join your account:

You can access the quick actions menu for managing user requests by clicking on the drop-down menu, or by clicking the three point icon in the right hand corner.

## Deleting data

In the *Data Explorer* section of the Workspace, you can view the list of your current data warehouse(s) and data observatory subscriptions. You can access the quick actions menu to manage your data by clicking on the "three dots" icon in the top-right corner. There are different options available depending on whether it is a table or a tileset.

If you click the *Delete* quick action, a dialog will appear allowing you to confirm that you want to delete the selected table or tileset. It includes information about data sources, layers, applications and API calls related to the existing dataset that could potentially be affected by the action. Click the *Yes, delete* button to confirm the changes or click *Cancel* if you don't want the changes to be applied.

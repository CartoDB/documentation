## Introduction

The CARTO Workspace includes functionalities for registering and managing connections to your data warehouse(s) of choice. Once you have registered a connection, you will then be able to perform different operations with the available data, like performing advanced spatial analysis with CARTO's Analytics Toolbox or creating stunning maps in Builder.

In the Connections section of the Workspace, you can access the list of your current connections. If you havenâ€™t registered a connection yet, you will see the following page:

### Quickstart guide to create your first map

#### Introduction

This is a quick guide to help you get started and is a step-by-step overview on how to connect CARTO to your data warehouse, explore your data, and create maps.

The CARTO Workspace includes functionalities for registering and managing connections to your data warehouse(s). Additionally, for each organization we also provision resources from the CARTO Data Warehouse to ensure you can get going with our technology from the beginning.

Once you have registered a connection to a data warehouse, you can start using your data with all components of the CARTO platform, such as running advanced spatial analysis with our Analytics Toolbox or creating stunning maps with Builder.

#### Create a connection

Go to the *Connections* section in the Workspace, where you can find the list of all your current connections. If you haven’t registered a connection yet, you will see the following page:

![Connections module](/img/cloud-native-workspace/connections/the_connections_the_cartodw.png)

To add a new connection, click on *New connection* and follow these steps:

1. Select your data warehouse from the list of support platforms: Google BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, or Snowflake.
2. Click the *Setup connection* button, or the *Connect using a service account* button if you are connecting to Google BigQuery.
3. Enter the connection parameters and credentials. You need to enter the connection parameters such as the server, username, password, or provide a service account, depending on the type of connector.

The following screen shows the connection setup options for Google Cloud BigQuery:

![Connection setup with BigQuery](/img/cloud-native-workspace/connections/the_connections_bq_the_parameters.png)

After you have provided the connection parameters, click the *Connect* button. Then you will see the list of your current connections with the new one added:

![Successful connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/connections/the_connections_bqconnection_successful.png)

#### Create a map

The *Maps* section enables you to create and manage maps in the CARTO Workspace.

1. From your *Maps* page, click *Create your first map*. This will open the CARTO map-making tool, Builder.
	
![Map module](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_map_module.png)

2. From the *Layers* tab on the left side, you can add data as a map layer from any of your existing data warehouse connections. In this example, we are using the BigQuery connection created in the previous step of this guide. With BigQuery we can use a custom SQL Query to retrieve data, add an entire table, or a tileset.

![Add source to your map](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_to_your_map.png)
		
3. A new dialog will open so you can select your data source. 

4. In this example we are going to use a table from our BigQuery connection. Select the table from the list and click *Add source*.

![Add source table](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_select_table.png)

Once the process is finished, the BigQuery table is included in Builder as a new layer to the map. You can add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features to the layer that you have just added.
	
![Map created](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_created.png)
#### Explore your spatial data

The *Data Explorer* section enables you to explore the contents accessible from your connected data warehouse, preview your geospatial tables and tilesets, and start creating maps or tilesets from your data. If you haven’t connected your own data warehouse yet, you will see the provisioned CARTO data warehouse connection with access to some demo data:

![Data Explorer carto data warehouse](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_carto_datawarehouse.png)

To add your first connection, you can follow the previous <a href="#create-a-connection" target="_blank">Guide</a> to create a data warehouse connection.

Once you have added a connection, go back to the *Data Explorer* section, where you will see the list with all of your current connections:

![Data Explorer first connection bigquery](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_bigquery.png)

Select a connection and start exploring the content (database/project(s), schemas/datasets, and tables) in a collapsible tree:

![Data Explorer content](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_content.png)

Once your table or tileset is selected, you can access a preview of the map and some metadata details of the selected table or tileset. You can create a map by clicking on the *Create map* button on the top. This will open the CARTO map-making tool, Builder. In case of large amounts of data, the user will be notified of the possibility to create a map with a dataset added as SQL query with a filter applied on it, or to create a tileset to visualize larger volumes of data from the table. 

![Data Explorer preview table](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_preview_map.png)

#### Create Tileset

{{% bannerNote title="ONLY FOR BIGQUERY AND CARTO DATA WAREHOUSE CONNECTIONS" type="tip" %}}
Creating tilesets is currently only available from BigQuery and CARTO Data Warehouse connections.
{{%/ bannerNote %}}

Check the <a href="/analytics-toolbox-bq/overview/tilesets/" target="_blank">Tileset</a> reference documentation for a better understanding of what a tileset is and how it works, as well as to get started using the BigQuery Tiler as a solution to visualise massive datasets hosted in BigQuery and CARTO Data Warehouse connections.

You can create a tileset by clicking on the *Create tileset* button at the top right of the screen. Please note that this option will only be available for those tables that require a tileset to be visualized entirely due to their size. 

![Data Explorer preview table2](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_preview_table2.png)

A new dialog will open so you can create the tileset from a *form* mode or from a *sql* mode. You are initially presented with a *form* mode to configure the tileset. 

This interface will allow you to select the tileset zoom levels, choose the geometry column and set the location and name of the output table. Once you have completed this configuration, click on *Continue* :

![Data Explorer create tileset (settings)](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_create_tileset(settings).png)

The next screen will allow you to easily select the attributes of your table that will be included in the tileset. After completing this step, click on *Continue* :

![Data Explorer create tileset (attributes)](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_create_tileset(attributes_selected).png)

The last screen will show you a summary of the configuration of the tileset for your confirmation. To confirm, click on *Create* :

![Data Explorer create tileset (confirmation)](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_create_tileset(confirmation).png)

At any point of the process you can switch to enable the *SQL editor*. This editor allows you to configure your tileset directly on the query that will be run to create it, therefore allowing you to edit all of the advanced options available. Once you have finished editing the SQL query, click on *Create*:

![Data Explorer create tileset sql editor](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_create_tileset_sql_editor.png)

Please note that if you edit the SQL query and go back to the form, a message appears warning you that all changes will be lost. Click on *Clear* to accept this or click on *Cancel* to continue editing:

![Data Explorer create tileset disable sql editor](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_disable_sql_editor.png)
#### Import data

CARTO allows to create geospatial tables in an organization's [CARTO Data Warehouse](../../connections/carto-data-warehouse), [BigQuery connection](../../connections/creating-a-connection/#connection-to-bigquery) and [Snowflake connection](../../connections/creating-a-connection/#connection-to-snowflake), by importing files from your computer or via URL. Once a file is imported, the resulting table can be previewed in Data Explorer and used in Builder and external applications to create maps.

To import your data, go to Data Explorer section, select  *Connections* panel and click on *Import data* button on the top left:

![Data Explorer import data icon](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_import_data_icon.png)

A new dialog will open allowing you to import your data into the available connections. Check [suppported formats](../../data-explorer/importing-data/#supported-formats) guide for more details.

![Data Explorer import select file](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_import_select_file.png)

You can import your data through two different methods: Local or Remote. For more details, check [Importing data](../../data-explorer/importing-data) guide.

#### Enrich your data with the Data Observatory

The Data Observatory is a spatial data platform that enables you to augment your data with the latest and greatest in spatial data. With a [catalog](https://carto.com/data) of thousands of spatial datasets from public and premium sources that have been vetted by our Data team, the Data Observatory provides a streamlined process to reduce the operational inefficiencies of discovering, licensing, and accessing spatial data.

We strongly recommend reading through the [Terminology](https://docs.carto.com/data-observatory/overview/terminology/) to get familiar with all the components of the Data Observatory.

In the following sections you will find a collection of resources where you can learn how to:

* [subscribe to Data Observatory data](https://docs.carto.com/data-observatory/overview/getting-started/#data-subscriptions),
* [access and introduce the data in your analysis workflows](https://docs.carto.com/data-observatory/overview/getting-started/#data-access-and-analysis),
* [visualize it](https://docs.carto.com/data-observatory/overview/getting-started/#data-visualization). 

<!-- Check out the following guides to learn how to find and subscribe to Data Observatory datasets:

- Browsing the Spatial Data Catalog [guide](../../data-observatory/browsing-the-spatial-data-catalog)
- Subscribing to public and premium datasets [guide](../../data-observatory/subscribing-to-public-and-premium-datasets)
- Managing your subscriptions [guide](../../data-observatory/managing-your-subscriptions) -->
#### Add data and style your maps

CARTO Builder contains many features that guide you through the process of creating a map, changing the styling, and selecting how your data appears rendered on a map. Use the following task list as a guide for some of the main features of CARTO Builder:

- Add your data [guide](../../maps/add-source)
- View your data table [guide](../../maps/view-data-table)
- Configure your map settings [guide](../../maps/map-settings)
- Style your maps [guide](../../maps/map-styles)

#### Export data

CARTO Builder allows you to export your data.

To export your data, add a source to the map and click on the *Export viewport data* button.

![Export data button enabled](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_export_data_enable.png) 

A new dialog screen will open informing you that the resulting CSV files will contain data from the current features in the viewport. Click the *Export data* button to confirm the download of the data or click on *Cancel* if you don’t want to continue exporting.

![Export data dialog](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_export_data_dialog.png) 

The result of the export will be a compressed file containing all visible features in the viewport in csv format.
#### Publish and share your map

By default all maps you create are set as private. With CARTO you can share your maps with your organization or publish them for anyone with the link.

Once you publish a map, you obtain a URL to share access to the map or HTML code to embed it on a website or blog. You can also get the map token to call the map when developing an application in CARTO. 

For details, see [Publishing and sharing maps](../../maps/publishing-and-sharing-maps).

#### Duplicate your map

This guide describes how you can duplicate existing maps from CARTO Workspace, the organization area; and also from CARTO Builder, our map editor. This option is available for all maps, whether you have admin or edit access.

![Duplicate map from Workspace (viewer)](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_duplicate_from_workspace(admin-editor).png)

![Duplicate map from Builder](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_duplicate_from_builder.png)

Copied maps will always start as `Copy of` plus the original map name, and will always started as private maps for yourself. 

When duplicating a map, you'll receive a warning if any of the sources is not shared with you (eg: a private connection) — You can continue anyway, but the private sources will load with errors and the corresponding layers will not be visible, leaving you the choice of fully removing them or asking for access. 

![Duplicate map - Data warning](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_duplicate_warning.png)

This ensures security across data sources, even when making editable map copies between users.

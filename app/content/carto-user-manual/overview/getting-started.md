### Quickstart guide to create your first map

#### Introduction

This is a quick guide to help you get started and is a step-by-step overview on how to connect CARTO to your data warehouse, explore your data, and create maps.

The CARTO Workspace includes functionalities for registering and managing connections to your data warehouse(s). Additionally, for each organization we also provision resources from the [CARTO Data Warehouse](../../connections/carto-data-warehouse) to ensure you can get going with our technology from the beginning.

Once you have registered a connection to a data warehouse, you can start using your data with all components of the CARTO platform, such as running advanced spatial analysis with our Analytics Toolbox or creating stunning maps with Builder.

#### Create a connection

Go to the *Connections* section in the Workspace, where you can find the list of all your current connections. If you haven’t registered a connection yet, you will see the following page:

![Connections module](/img/cloud-native-workspace/connections/the_connections_the_cartodw.png)

To add a new connection, click on *New connection* and follow these steps:

1. Select your data warehouse from the list of support platforms: Google BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, or Snowflake.
2. Click the *Setup connection* button, or the *Connect using a service account* button if you are connecting to Google BigQuery.
3. Enter the connection parameters and credentials. You need to enter the connection parameters such as the server, username, password, or provide a service account, depending on the type of connector.

The following screen shows the connection setup options for Google Cloud BigQuery:

![Connection setup with BigQuery](/img/cloud-native-workspace/connections/the_connections_bq_the_parameters.png)

After you have provided the connection parameters, click the *Connect* button. Then you will see the list of your current connections with the new one added:

![Successful connection](/img/cloud-native-workspace/connections/the_connections_bqconnection_successful.png)

You can manage your connections to your data warehouse(s) through different options: edit, delete or share your connection. For more details, check the [Creating a connection](../../connections/creating-a-connection) guide.

#### Explore your spatial data

The *Data Explorer* section enables you to explore the contents accessible from your connected data warehouse, preview your geospatial tables and tilesets, and start creating maps or tilesets from your data. If you haven’t connected your own data warehouse yet, you will see the provisioned `CARTO data warehouse connection` with access to some demo data:

![Data Explorer carto data warehouse](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_carto_datawarehouse.png)

To add your first connection, you can follow the previous <a href="#create-a-connection" target="_blank">Guide</a> to create a data warehouse connection.

Once you have added a connection, go back to the *Data Explorer* section, where you will see the list with all of your current connections:

![Data Explorer first connection bigquery](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_bigquery.png)

Select a connection and start exploring the content (database/project(s), schemas/datasets, and tables) in a collapsible tree:

![Data Explorer content](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_content.png)

Once your table or tileset is selected, you can access a preview of the map and some metadata details of the selected table or tileset. You can create a map by clicking on the *Create map* button on the top. This will open the CARTO map-making tool, Builder. In case of large amounts of data, the user will be notified of the possibility to create a map with a dataset added as SQL query with a filter applied on it, or to create a tileset to visualize larger volumes of data from the table. 

![Data Explorer preview table](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_preview_map.png)

#### Create a map

The *Maps* section enables you to create and manage maps in the CARTO Workspace.

From your *Maps* page, click *Create your first map*. This will open the CARTO map-making tool, Builder.
	
   ![Map module](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_map_create_first_map.png)

You can also getting some ideas from our sample maps.

   ![Map module](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/the_map_try_sample_maps.png)

From the *Layers* tab on the left side, you can add data as a map layer from any of your existing data warehouse connections. In this example, we are using the BigQuery connection created in the previous step of this guide. With BigQuery we can use a custom SQL Query to retrieve data, add an entire table, or a tileset.

![Add source to your map](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_from.png)
		
A new dialog will open so you can select your connection and your data source. 

![Add source to your map](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_select_connection.png)

In this example we are going to use a table from our BigQuery connection. Select the table from the list and click *Add source*.

![Add source table](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_select_data_source.png)

Once the process is finished, the BigQuery table is included in Builder as a new layer to the map. You can add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features to the layer that you have just added.
	
![Map created](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_layer_added.png)

CARTO Builder contains many features that guide you through the process of creating a map, changing the styling, and selecting how your data appears rendered on a map. Use the following task list as a guide for some of the main features of CARTO Builder:

- Add your data [guide](../../maps/add-source)
- Configure your map settings [guide](../../maps/map-settings)
- Style your maps [guide](../../maps/map-styles)
- Customize your map views [guide](../../maps/map-view-modes)
- Apply a mask to your map and filter out your data [guide](../../maps/feature-selection-tool)
- Add spatial sql analysis [guide](../../maps/sql-analyses)
- Publish and share your maps [guide](../../maps/publishing-and-sharing-maps)


For more details, see [Creating a map from your data](../../data-explorer/creating-a-map-from-your-data).

#### Create a tileset

{{% bannerNote title="AVAILABLE FOR BIGQUERY, SNOWFLAKE AND REDSHIFT CONNECTIONS" type="tip" %}}
Creating tilesets is currently only available from BigQuery, Snowflake and Redshift connections.
{{%/ bannerNote %}}

<!-- {{% bannerNote title="ONLY FOR BIGQUERY AND CARTO DATA WAREHOUSE CONNECTIONS" type="tip" %}}
Creating tilesets is currently only available from BigQuery and CARTO Data Warehouse connections.
{{%/ bannerNote %}} -->

Check this [reference documentation](../../data-explorer/creating-a-tileset-from-your-data) to get started using the Tiler module as a solution to visualise massive datasets hosted in BigQuery, Snowflake and Redshift connections.

<!-- for a better understanding of what a tileset is and how it works, as well as  -->

To learn more, please visit the Documentation page of the CARTO Analytics Toolbox for each provider: 
* <a href="/analytics-toolbox-bigquery/overview/tilesets/" target="_blank"> CARTO BigQuery Tiler</a> (also valid for the CARTO Data Warehouse)
- <a href="/analytics-toolbox-snowflake/overview/tilesets/" target="_blank"> CARTO Snowflake Tiler</a>
- <a href="/analytics-toolbox-redshift/overview/tilesets/" target="_blank"> CARTO Redshift Tiler</a> 

<!-- BigQuery and CARTO Data Warehouse connections. -->

You can create a tileset by clicking on the *Create tileset* button at the top right of the screen. Please note that this option will only be available for those tables that require a tileset to be visualized entirely due to their size. 

![Data Explorer create tileset button](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_create_tileset.png)

Now from this interface will allow you to set the location and name of the output tileset in a directory where the user has write permissions. Once you have completed this configuration, click on *Save here*.

![Data Explorer tileset destination](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_tileset_destination.png)

A new dialog will open so you can create the tileset from a *form* mode or from a *sql* mode. You are initially presented with a *form* mode to configure the tileset. You need to select the tileset zoom levels and choose the geometry column. You can also add a custom description to the tileset. Once you have completed this configuration, click on *Continue*.

![Data Explorer tileset settings](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_tileset_settings.png)

The next screen will allow you to easily select the attributes of your table that will be included in the tileset. After completing this step, click on *Continue* :

![Data Explorer tileset attributes](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_tileset_attributes.png)

The last screen will show you a summary of the configuration of the tileset for your confirmation. To confirm, click on *Create* :

![Data Explorer tileset confirmation](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_tileset_confirmation.png)

At any point of the process you can switch to enable the *SQL editor*. This editor allows you to configure your tileset directly on the query that will be run to create it, therefore allowing you to edit all of the advanced options available. Once you have finished editing the SQL query, click on *Create*:

![Data Explorer create tileset sql editor](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_create_tileset_sql_editor.png)

Please note that if you edit the SQL query and go back to the form, a message appears warning you that all changes will be lost. Click on *Clear* to accept this or click on *Cancel* to continue editing:

![Data Explorer create tileset disable sql editor](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_disable_sql_editor.png)

You can follow up your tileset creation process and check the status: creating tileset, tileset created successfully or tileset creation error. For more details, check the [Creating a tileset from your data](../../data-explorer/creating-a-tileset-from-your-data) guide.

#### Import data

CARTO allows to create geospatial tables in an organization's [CARTO Data Warehouse](../../connections/carto-data-warehouse), [BigQuery connection](../../connections/creating-a-connection/#connection-to-bigquery) and [Snowflake connection](../../connections/creating-a-connection/#connection-to-snowflake), by importing files from your computer or via URL. Once a file is imported, the resulting table can be previewed in Data Explorer and used in Builder and external applications to create maps.

To import your data, go to Data Explorer section, select  *Connections* panel and click on *Import data* button on the top left:

![Data Explorer import data icon](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_import_data_icon.png)

A new dialog will open allowing you to import your data into the available connections. Check [suppported formats](../../data-explorer/importing-data/#supported-formats) guide for more details.

![Data Explorer import select file](/img/cloud-native-workspace/data-explorer/de_import_select_file_check.png)

You can import your data through two different methods: Local or Remote. For more details, check [Importing data](../../data-explorer/importing-data) guide.

#### Enrich your data with the Data Observatory

The Data Observatory is a spatial data platform that enables you to augment your data with the latest and greatest in spatial data. With a [catalog](https://carto.com/data) of thousands of spatial datasets from public and premium sources that have been vetted by our Data team, the Data Observatory provides a streamlined process to reduce the operational inefficiencies of discovering, licensing, and accessing spatial data.

We strongly recommend reading through the [Terminology](https://docs.carto.com/data-observatory/overview/terminology/) to get familiar with all the components of the Data Observatory.

In the following sections you will find a collection of resources where you can learn how to:

* [subscribe to Data Observatory data](https://docs.carto.com/data-observatory/overview/getting-started/#data-subscriptions),
* [access and introduce the data in your analysis workflows](https://docs.carto.com/data-observatory/overview/getting-started/#data-access-and-analysis),
* [visualize it](https://docs.carto.com/data-observatory/overview/getting-started/#data-visualization). 

You can follow up the steps for the enrichment creation process in the [Enriching data](../../data-explorer/enriching-data) guide.

#### Export data

CARTO Builder allows you to export your data.

To export your data, add a source to the map and click on the *Export viewport data* button.

![Export data button enabled](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_export_data_button.png) 

A new dialog screen will open informing you that the resulting CSV files will contain data from the current features in the viewport. Click the *Export data* button to confirm the download of the data or click on *Cancel* if you don’t want to continue exporting.

![Export data dialog](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_export_data_dialog.png) 

The result of the export will be a compressed file containing all visible features in the viewport in csv format.

#### Duplicate your map

You can duplicate existing maps from CARTO Workspace, the organization area; and also from CARTO Builder, our map editor. This option is available for all maps, whether you have admin or edit access.

To make a copy of an existing map from **CARTO Workspace**, go to “Maps” and click on the three-dotted menu in each map card. If you are the owner of the map, you will have access to the 3 available options: Edit name & description, Duplicate map and Delete.

![Recent maps](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/recent_maps_new_options.png)

To make a copy of an existing map from **CARTO Builder**, add data or a title to the map and click on the three-dotted menu in the top right of Builder. 

![Duplicate map from Builder](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_duplicate_button.png) 

Copied maps will always start as `Copy of` plus the original map name, and will always started as private maps for yourself. 

When duplicating a map, you'll receive a warning if any of the sources is not shared with you (eg: a private connection) — You can continue anyway, but the private sources will load with errors and the corresponding layers will not be visible, leaving you the choice of fully removing them or asking for access. 

![Duplicate map - Data warning](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_duplicate_warning.png)

This ensures security across data sources, even when making editable map copies between users. 

For more details, see [Duplicating maps](../../maps/duplicating-maps).

#### Delete your map

You can also delete existing maps from CARTO Workspace, the organization area; and also from CARTO Builder, our map editor.

To delete an existing map from **CARTO Workspace**, go to “Maps” and click on the three-dotted menu in each map card. If you are the owner of the map, you will have access to the 3 available options: Edit name & description, Duplicate map and Delete.

![Recent maps](/img/cloud-native-workspace/get-started/recent_maps_new_options.png)

To delete an existing map from **CARTO Builder**, click on the three-dotted menu in the top right of Builder.

![Duplicate map from Builder](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_delete_button.png)

For more details, see [Deleting maps](../../maps/deleting-maps).

#### Publish and share your map

By default all maps you create are set as private. With CARTO you can share your maps with your organization or publish them for anyone with the link.

Once you publish a map, you obtain a URL to share access to the map or HTML code to embed it on a website or blog. You can also get the map token to call the map when developing an application in CARTO. 

There are different sharing options, like sharing visualizations in a protected way with a map password or controlling how it is displayed using URL parameters.For more details, check the [Publishing and sharing maps](../../maps/publishing-and-sharing-maps) guide.

## Accessing your subscriptions from your data warehouse

You can access your subscriptions directly from your data warehouses [connected to CARTO](https://docs.carto.com/carto-user-manual/connections/creating-a-connection/). This is currently supported for BigQuery and Snowflake; Redshift and Databricks support is coming soon.

You can access your Data Observatory subscriptions directly from BigQuery and Snowflake by clicking on *Access in BigQuery* or *Access in Snowflake*, respectively. Check [this guide](https://docs.carto.com/data-observatory/guides/accessing-your-subscriptions-from-your-data-warehouse/) to know more.

## Subscribing to public and premium datasets

From the Spatial Data Catalog, you can instantly subscribe to any of our public datasets and submit requests to start the licensing process of premium datasets from our vetted data sources.

### Public datasets

If the dataset license is public, within the dataset page in the Spatial Data Catalog you can click on *Subscribe for free* to start the subscription process.

After that, you will have to read an approve the license terms of that data source, and finally confirm the subscription.

Subscriptions are synced to a CARTO table when the dataset is smaller than 2GB. For public datasets this counts against your available storage quota. However, for premium datasets the necessary storage quota is provided by CARTO as part of the premium data license, which is added to the storage quota of your account. You can check this in your Usage Metrics.

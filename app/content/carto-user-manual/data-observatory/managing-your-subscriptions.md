## Managing your subscriptions

Through *Data Observatory* panel within the *Data Explorer* section in the Workspace you can check all relevant details to manage and access the different Data Observatory datasets you subscribed to.

For those datasets supported by Builder, users can use this interface to directly access the data or create a new map / tileset through the options *Access in* and *Create > Create map / Create tileset*, respectively. 

You can access your Data Observatory subscriptions directly from BigQuery by clicking on *Access in BigQuery*. Check [`accesing your subscriptions from BigQuery`](/data-observatory/guides/accessing-your-subscriptions-from-bigquery-aws-or-azure/) guide to know more.

Some of the spatial datasets offered in the Data Observatory are massive (a few TB) and their visualization requires the creation of tilesets. Check this [`guide`](/data-observatory/guides/creating-data-observatory-tilesets/) to learn more about how to create tilesets from your Data Observatory datasets.

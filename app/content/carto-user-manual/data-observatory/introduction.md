## Introduction

The Data Observatory section in the Workspace allows users to explore thousands of spatial datasets available in the CARTO's Spatial Data Catalog, in order to find the best data for their use-case

<!-- The Spatial Data Catalog is built on top of a smart metadata system that has registered all characteristics defining a data product in an homogenous manner (i.e., provider, coverage, schema, variable description, sample data, etc.). This system enables us to provide a unified experience for users to explore and understand the details of very different types of spatial data.
 -->
The Spatial Data Catalog is available from our [public website](http://www.carto.com/data) and also from within your Workspace once you [log into](http://app.carto.com/) your account and navigate to the "Data Observatory" section from the left-side menu.

There are a set of high-level metadata attributes that allow the user to filter different datasets when browsing the Spatial Data Catalog:
- Countries -- The geographical coverage of the datasets.
- Categories -- The type of data product (e.g., demographic, human mobility, road traffic, environmental, etc.)
- Licenses -- Identifies whether the dataset access is governed by a public or premium license.
- Sources -- The premium data provider or public data source of the datasets.
- Placetypes -- The type of spatial aggregation used in the dataset (e.g. admin region, postal codes, road segments, grids, etc.).

You can access to a sample of the data, subscribe to any of our public datasets or submit requests to start the licensing process of premium datasets from our vetted data sources.

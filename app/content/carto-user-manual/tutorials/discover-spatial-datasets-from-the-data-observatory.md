<!-- ## Discover spatial datasets from the Data Observatory

**Steps To Reproduce**

1. Go to the <a href="http://app.carto.com/signup" target="_blank">CARTO signup</a> page.
   - Click on *Log in*.
   - Enter your email address and password. You can also log in with your existing Google account by clicking *Continue with Google*.
   - Once you have entered your credentials: click *Continue*.

2. From the Navigation Menu in the left panel, select Data Observatory.

3. Browse through the Spatial Data Catalog and identify your dataset of interest. For more details check the [Browsing the Spatial Data Catalog](../../data-observatory/browsing-the-spatial-data-catalog) guide.

4. Click on *Access free sample* to have access to a sample of the data. You will have to then accept the Terms of Use for accessing the sample data only for evaluation purposes. Finally click on *Connect sample*

5. Now you have access to the selected sample in the Data Observatory panel of the Data Explorer. This sample is as any other table in the Data Explorer. This means that you can access the map and data preview of the table as well as create a map in Builder.

6. If you click on *View dataset*, you will be able to access again to the associated dataset page in the Spatial Data Catalog.

7. The Spatial Data Catalog now also detects that you already have connected a sample of that dataset, so from the Catalog you can now go back to the Data Explorer to check the sample data by clicking on *View sample*.

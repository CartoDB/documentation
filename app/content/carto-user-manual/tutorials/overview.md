## Overview

The `CARTO Data Warehouse` connection grants access to a set of demo tables and tilesets that can be used to start creating stunning maps and exploring the tools from the very beginning. 

They're available and ready to be used in the Data Explorer and Builder and you can start using them with all components of the CARTO platform, such as running advanced spatial analysis with our Analytics Toolbox, with everything running directly on top of the provisioned `CARTO Data Warehouse`connection. 

In this section, we provide a varied set of tutorials on how to get the most out of your data:

- [Build a categories & bubbles visualization](../../tutorials/build-a-categories-and-bubbles-visualization)

- [Build an animated visualization with time series](../../tutorials/build-an-animated-visualization-with-time-series)

- [Build a 3D map with a tileset](../../tutorials/build-a-3d-map-with-a-tileset)

- [Find the best place to create a store near the customers](../../tutorials/find-the-best-place-to-create-a-store-near-the-customers)

- [Create a tileset and build a basic visualization](../../tutorials/create-a-tileset-and-build-a-basic-visualization)

- [Assessing the damages of La Palma´s Volcano](../../tutorials/assessing-the-damages-of-la-palma-volcano)

Therefore, we can easily understand how the human settlement areas is distributed with a simple visualization that we can use in further analysis." %}}

In this example, filters are applied by specie and date of planting." %}}

We are going to represent the distribution of land elevation by using a gradual color palette and then build a 3D visualization by assigning heights to polygons." %}}

We’ll also estimate the value of damaged residential properties affected by the volcano eruption." %}}

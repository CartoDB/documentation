## Configuring your organization

CARTO Workspace includes several options for configuring your organization. From the *Settings* menu, you can rename your organization, manage who can join your organization, view the details of your organization plan, register existing apps, invite users to join your organization, and delete your organization.
### Managing who can join your organization

From the *General* section, you can rename your organization name or manage who can join your organization. Select the checkbox if you want someone with the same email domain to automatically join your organization, or leave it unchecked if you want them to go through an approval process to be able to join your organization:

### Approving requests

From the *User* section, you can easily identify the users who have requested to join your organization by the means of a hand icon and a popup stating 'Join request'. You can access the quick actions menu for managing user requests by clicking on the drop-down menu, or by clicking the three point icon in the right hand corner. There are two options available: Accept Request or Decline it.

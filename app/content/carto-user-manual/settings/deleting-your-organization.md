## Deleting your organization

The CARTO Workspace includes the option to delete account organizations. Deleting an organization includes the deletion of all maps, connections, users, and any content created. A text warns you to proceed with caution.

If you click the Delete option, a dialog will appear so you can enter your organization name and confirm that you want to delete the account. Click the *Yes, delete* button to confirm the changes or click Cancel if you donâ€™t want the changes to be applied.

## Managing user roles

From the *User* section, you can view the list of users who have access to your organization. You can access the quick actions menu to manage users role by clicking on the drop-down menu, or by clicking the three point icon in the right hand corner. There are three options available: Make Admin, Make Editor, and Delete organization.

### Making Admin

If you click the Make Admin quick action, you are providing **Admin** role to that user. Admins can do everything an editor can do, plus they can access the Organization Settings. This allows them to invite other users, modify their roles, check organization quotas...

There can be more than one admin in a given organization.

### Making Editor

If you click the Make Editor quick action, you are providing **Editor** role to that user. Editors can create connections, applications and maps, as well as edit them.

### Making Viewer

If you click the Make Viewer quick action, you are providing **Viewer** role to that user. Viewers can only see maps and applications previously shared with them.

### Deleting User

If you click the Delete user quick action, a dialog will appear allowing you to confirm that you want to delete the user. Click the *Yes, delete* button to confirm the changes or click Cancel if you donâ€™t want the changes to be applied.

If you downgrade to viewer or fully delete a user, all assets (maps, connections, applications...) belonging to that user will be transferred to you, that is, the admin making the action.

## Customizing appearance and branding

Customers that require custom styles and logos can change the appearance of both Workspace and Builder to their needs. This effectively reduces the presence of CARTO to attribution-only, allowing scenarios where white-labeling is interesting, such as publicly shared maps.

Branding customizations are only available to selected customers in **Enterprise Large** plans or above, and it needs to be manually enabled by CARTO. If you're interested in this feature, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@carto.com).

To customize the appearance of CARTO, go to **Settings** > **Appearance**. Then click on **Customize appearance**.

You can define the following styles:

- **Logo**: the logo in the header. It needs to be a square image file (like an avatar) with a minimum dimensions of 256x256 pixels and a maximum file size of 1MB.

- **Primary color**: the primary color used in the UI. Buttons in Workspace and Builder will use this color.

- **Secondary color**: this color is used for accent and in some components for data visualization. For example, widgets in Builder will use this color.

- **Use primary colors for the App bar (header)**: enable this option if you want to reuse the primary color for the header in Builder and Workspace. Disable that option if you want to customize the header.

If the "Use primary colors..." setting is disabled:

- **App bar background**: set this color to customize the header background.

- **App bar contrast text**: set this color to customize some components that need contrast with the background in the header.

Once you "Save Changes", the UI will start applying the new styles. Some changes might take a bit to appear. Remember that these settings will be applied to all users and viewers.

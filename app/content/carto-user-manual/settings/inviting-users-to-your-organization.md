## Inviting users to your organization 

The CARTO Workspace includes the option to invite users to your organization. From the *Settings* section, you can invite a user, manage their role, or delete a user.

Click *Invite* to invite select users by sending an email. You must also select the user role as Editor (can create and edit maps and other assets) or Viewer (can only see maps and applications shared with them).

The following screen shows the *Invite user* dialog box:

After adding an email address and a user role, click the *Invite* button. A popup will appear informing you that the invitation has been correctly sent. Otherwise, click *Cancel* if you donâ€™t want to sent the invitation.

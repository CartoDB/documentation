## Inviting users to your organization 

The CARTO Workspace includes the option to invite users to your organization. From the *Settings* section, you can invite a user, manage their role, or delete a user.

From "Users", click on *Invite user*. A new dialog screen will open allowing you invite users by sending an email and select the user role. The role is always *Editor* by default.

The three existing roles can be assigned to the invited user:

- **Admin**: Have full access and can manage the organization and its users.
- **Editor**: Can create and edit maps and other assets.
- **Viewer**: Can only see maps and applications shared with them.

<!-- Click *Invite user* to invite users by sending an email. You must also select the user role as Admin (have full access and can manage the organization and its users), Editor (can create and edit maps and other assets) or Viewer (can only see maps and applications shared with them). -->

After adding an email address and a user role, click the *Invite* button. A popup will appear informing you that the invitation has been correctly sent. Otherwise, click on *Cancel* if you donâ€™t want to sent the invitation.

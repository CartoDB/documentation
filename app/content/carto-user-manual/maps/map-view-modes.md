## Map view modes

This guide describes how to switch between different map view modes in Builder. There are two different map view modes, normal (flat) and 3D. The mode selected by default is the **Normal** map view.

To switch to 3D view, click on *3D view* from the "Map view" options.

Also, another cool functionality of CARTO Builder is the ability to have a dual map configuration to allow comparisons. We can switch to this mode by selecting *Switch a dual map view* from the “Map view” options.

You can always back to the single map configuration by clicking on *Exit dual map view* and selecting the panel you want to close.

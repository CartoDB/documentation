## Publishing and sharing maps

This guide describes how you can share any CARTO map with your teammates, or publish a map to the internet, using CARTO Builder.

When you create a map, it's always **private** by default. 

To be able to share a map, you need to add data and a title to the map:

Once you have added data and a title to your map, the *Share* button will be enabled and you will be able to share your maps with your organization, by clicking the *Share* button on the top-right to open the sharing options.

A new dialog screen will open allowing you to select who you want to share your maps with:

Here you'll find three different sharing options:

* **Private**: Only you can view and open it.
* **Organization**: The map will be visible to all users in your organization.
* **Public Map**: The map will be visible to anyone in the internet with the link.

Remember that if your map is "shared" or "public" you'll need to push your changes with the "Publish Updates" button, next to the sharing button in the top-right menu. 

Public maps have some extra options: to share the link with the public, to get Developers information for embedding, or to work with CARTO for developers. You can toggle between these subtabs and select the option you are interested in.

#### Publishing updates for shared and public maps

Once your map is shared or public, you can manage the state of the map for your viewers (so your editing doesn't affect their experience). When you're ready to push an update, click on the *Publish Updates* icon:

You will see the date for the last time the map changes were pushed to the viewers. If you want to update it and push the current version, click on *Publish Updates*:

Viewers will see always the version of the map that you last updated.

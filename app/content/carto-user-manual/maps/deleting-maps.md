## Deleting maps

This guide describes how you can delete existing maps from CARTO Workspace, the organization area; and also from CARTO Builder, our map editor.

#### Deleting a map in Workspace

To delete an existing map, go to “Maps” and click on the three-dotted menu in each map card. If you are the owner of the map, you will have access to the 3 available options: Edit name & description, Duplicate map and Delete.

#### Deleting a map in Builder

To be able to delete a map from Builder, click on the three-dotted menu in the top right of Builder.

<!-- A new dialog screen will open allowing you to delete your map. -->

When you click the Delete quick action, a dialog will appear allowing you to confirm that you want to delete the selected map and warning you that this action cannot be undone.

{{% bannerNote title="WARNING" type="warning"%}}
Note that if you delete a map that is **shared** (Organization or Public Map), other users will lose access to it and the public version of the map will become unavailable.

<!-- In the following examples, the dialogs that will appear to confirm that you want to delete the map shared with your organization or the public map.
 -->

In the following examples, the map has been shared and therefore the dialog shows a different warning depending on whether your map has been shared with the organization or it is a public version.

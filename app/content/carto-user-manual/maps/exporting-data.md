## Exporting data

This guide describes how you can export your data using CARTO Builder.

To be able to export your data, you need to add data to the map:

Once you have added data to your map, the *Export viewport data* button will be enabled and you will be able to export your data.

A new dialog screen will open informing you that the resulting CSV files will contain data from the current features in the viewport. Click the *Export data* button to confirm the download of the data or click on *Cancel* if you donâ€™t want to continue exporting.

In this example, we filter our data by adding widgets to our map. The result of our export will be our data already filtered in the map viewport.

The result of the export will be a compressed file containing all visible features in the viewport in csv format.

## Add source

When you open a map, the Layers tab will appear on the left side panel. There you can add data as layers to the map by clicking on *Add source from*, where you can access the contents from your existing data warehouse connections. If you havenâ€™t added a data layer to the map yet, you will see the following page:

![Add source to your map](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_to_your_map.png)

### Add source from a connection

From the Layers tab, go to the Sources panel and click on *Add source from...*. A new dialog screen will open allowing you to select a table or a tileset from on of your connections. Insert the *Fully Qualified Table* or the *Tileset Name* and click *Add source*.

![Add source select a table](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_select_table.png)

Once the process is finished, the table or tileset is included in the Builder map as a new layer. The map displays the basemap and the new layer on top. You can add additional layers, or start applying styling and analysis features.

Once you have added your datasets to the map, you can visualize the data table. Click on the three dots icon, select *Show data table* and your dataset table will be displayed. 

![Map source options view data table](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_source_options.png)

By clicking the *tree dots* icon the Column Context menu will reveal additional options such as: Sort on this column, ascending or descending, Pin the column so you can freeze it in the first position, and copy column data.

Once you have added your datasets to the map, you can always add a new layer or delete the source. Click on the three dots icon and select *Add layer* or *Delete source*.

### Add source from a custom query

From the Layers tab, go to the Sources panel and click on *Add source from...*. A new dialog screen will open allowing you to create your own query or run a SQL analysis to data on your connection. Select an option and click *Add source*.

![Add source custom query](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_a_custom_query.png)

![Add source analysis query](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_an_analysis_query.png)

Once the process is finished, the SQL console appears in the Builder interface, where you can type your query and then click *Run*. Please make sure to use *Fully Qualified Table* names.

![Map sql console](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_sql_console.png)

In this example we are going to use a table accessible via a BigQuery connection. The BigQuery table is included in the Builder map tool as a new layer. You can add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features.

#### Custom queries using the Analytics Toolbox

You can also use the Analytics Toolbox functions in your custom SQL queries. For example, you can perform a simple clustering using the [`ST_CLUSTERKMEANS`](/analytics-toolbox-bq/sql-reference/clustering/#st_clusterkmeans) function by running this query from your CARTO Data Warehouse connection:

```sql
with clustered_points AS
(
    SELECT `carto-un`.clustering.ST_CLUSTERKMEANS(ARRAY_AGG(geom ignore nulls), 6) AS cluster_arr
    FROM carto-demo-data.demo_tables.sample_customer_home_locations
)

SELECT cluster_element.cluster, cluster_element.geom AS geom FROM clustered_points, UNNEST(cluster_arr) AS cluster_element
```

This query computes five clusters from the points of the `sample_customer_home_locations` table. As a result, each point is assigned a `cluster` ID. By styling the layer by this `cluster` attribute, we get the following result:

To learn more, please visit the Documentation page of the CARTO Analytics Toolbox for each provider: 
* [Analytics Toolbox for BigQuery](/analytics-toolbox-bigquery) (also valid for the CARTO Data Warehouse)
* [Analytics Toolbox for Snowflake](/analytics-toolbox-snowflake)
* [Analytics Toolbox for Redshift](/analytics-toolbox-redshift)
* [Analytics Toolbox for Databricks](/analytics-toolbox-databricks)

### Add source from a local or remote file

CARTO allows to create geospatial tables in an organization's CARTO Datawarehouse by importing files from your computer or via URL. Once a file is imported, the resulting table can be previewed in Data Explorer and used in Builder and external applications to create maps.

#### Supported formats
Currently, the import of CSV, KML, KMZ, TAB, GeoJSON, GeoPackage and Shapefiles (in a zip file) is supported. The size limit for a single import process is 512MB. Please [get in touch](mailto:support@carto.com) with us if you need a higher limit. 

For CSV files, CARTO will try and autodetect the geometry column or create the geometries from latitude/longitude columns. The supported column names are: 
* For *geometry*: `geom,Geom,geometry,the_geom,wkt,wkb`
* For *latitude*: `latitude,lat,Latitude`
* For *longitude*: `longitude,lon,Lon,Longitude,lng,Lng`

The expected delimiters are: comma (`,`), semi-colon (`;`) or a tabulation.


From the Layers tab, go to the Sources panel, click on *Add source from...* and select *Import file*. A new dialog will open allowing you to import your data from your computer into the provisioned `CARTO Data Warehouse` connection. 

![Add source import file](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_add_source_import_a_file.png)

You can upload your data through two different methods: Local or Remote.

-  **Local**

To import a local file, select the icon on the left:

![Map import local](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_import_local.png)

This interface will allow you to upload a supported file, such as GeoJSON or Shapefile (.zip), into `CARTO Data Warehouse` and set the name of the output table on your organization data *shared* folder.

![Map add source import local file](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_import_local_file.png)

Once you have completed this configuration, click on *Continue* : 

![Map add source import local file continue](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_import_local_file_continue.png)

The next screen will show you a summary of the configuration of the table for your confirmation. Click on *Add Source* to confirm or click on *Edit details* to edit your import file.

![Map add source import confirmation local file](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_import_confirmation_local_file.png)

Once you click on Add Source, a new dialog will open informing you that the import may take a while to process and that once the file has been imported, it will be added as a data source to the map.

![Map add source importing local file](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_importing_local_file.png)

Once the data has been imported, the dataset is included in the Builder map tool as a new layer. You can then add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features.

![Map add source import urban areas](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_import_urban_areas.png)

-  **Remote**

To import a remote URL, select the icon on the right.

![Map import remote](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_import_remote.png)

This interface will allow you to enter your supported URL file, such as GeoJSON or Shapefile (.zip), into `CARTO Data Warehouse` and set the name of the output table on your organization data *shared* folder.

![Map add source import remote url](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_import_remote_url.png)

Once you have completed this configuration, click on *Continue* : 

![Map add source import remote url continue](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_import_remote_url_continue.png)

The next screen will show you a summary of the configuration of the table for your confirmation. Click on *Add Source* to confirm or click on *Edit details* to edit your import file.

![Map add source import confirmation remote url](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_import_confirmation_remote_url.png)

Once you click on Add Source, a new dialog will open informing you that the import may take a while to process and that once the file has been imported, it will be added as a data source to the map.

![Map add source importing remote url](/img/cloud-native-workspace/maps/map_importing_remote_url.png)

Once the data has been imported, the dataset is included in the Builder map tool as a new layer. You can then add additional layers, or apply styling and analysis features.

## Feature Selection tool

The Selection tool allows you to draw a shape on the map and apply a filter to select the features within the shape. This guide describes how to start using this fantastic tool and get the most out of your maps.

You can explore this new tool by clicking on the button on the upper right corner of the map.

There are different selection modes supporting different shapes. The mode selected by default is `Polygon`.

Click on one of the selection modes to activate the tool and start drawing and filtering. The blue icon means that the tool is activated.

The selection tool operates on the active layers on the map, and it is used by clicking and dragging to trace the vertices of a selection.

After tracing the vertices of your shape, double click on it to stop drawing.

Once the shape has been drawn, it can be selected and modified by adding/removing/moving vertices or by moving the shape to a new location.  To perform one of these actions, the shape has to be in edit mode by clicking on *Edit Mask*.

Once in editing mode, the shape will turn blue and the different vertices will appear so that it can be modified or moved to a different location.

By default the mask is active but it can be disabled temporarily by clicking on *Clear mask* and re-enabled again by clicking on *Apply mask*. You can also click on the "X" to remove it permanently.

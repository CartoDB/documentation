## Getting started

The CARTO Analytics Toolbox for BigQuery is a set of UDFs and Stored Procedures to unlock Spatial Analytics. It is organized in a set of modules based on the functionality they offer. There are two types of modules: _core_ modules, that are [open source](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-spatial-extension) and free to use for anyone with a BigQuery account, and _advanced_ modules, only available with a CARTO account.

Visit the [SQL Reference](../../sql-reference/) to see the full list of available modules and functions. If you already have a CARTO account, please visit [this guide](/analytics-toolbox-bq/overview/getting-access/#access-from-the-new-carto-workspace) on how to get access to the entire collection of modules of the Analytics Toolbox. If you don't have a CARTO account and are looking to access the _core_ modules for free, please [follow these instructions](/analytics-toolbox-bq/overview/getting-access/#free-access-to-the-core-modules) instead.

## Getting started

The CARTO Analytics Toolbox for Snowflake is composed of a set of user-defined functions and procedures organized in a set of modules based on the functionality they offer. There are two types of modules: _core_ modules, which are [open source](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-spatial-extension) and _advanced_.

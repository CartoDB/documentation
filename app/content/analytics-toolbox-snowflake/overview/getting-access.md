You can get access to the Analytics Toolbox for Snowflake through the [Snowflake's Data Marketplace](https://www.snowflake.com/datasets/carto-spatial-extension/). If you are unsure of how to access the Data Marketplace, you can find detailed instructions in [this article](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-marketplace-intro.html#how-do-i-access-the-snowflake-data-marketplace-to-browse-listings) of Snowflake's documentation center.

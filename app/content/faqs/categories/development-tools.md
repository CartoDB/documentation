##### What frameworks and libraries can I use for developing custom apps with CARTO?
You can use any framework or visualization library because CARTO is based on industry-standards. If there is not a hard requirement, we recommend using deck.gl for visualization and CARTO for React for creating apps that extend the platform functionality.

##### What is the new version of the CARTO Platform?
In October 2021, we launched a fully revamped version of the [CARTO platform](http://www.carto.com/carto3/). The new platform offers a complete cloud native experience, allowing to run CARTO on top of the leading cloud data warehouse platforms (e.g. Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift, Snowflake, etc.), eliminating ETL complexity and limits on scalability. 

This new platform works completely independent of the previous version of CARTO; hence, requires a different set of user credentials to access. You can learn more about the new platform with our [User Manual](https://docs.carto.com/carto-user-manual/overview/getting-started/#getting-started). 

##### Is the previous version of CARTO going to be deprecated? 
No, we don’t have plans to deprecate the previous version of our platform for our existing customers, so you don’t need to worry about that now. However, it is important to note that any new product developments will happen only in the new version of CARTO.

You can continue to login to the previous version of CARTO by selecting the “CARTO Dashboard” option on our [Login page](https://carto.com/signin/). 

Free trials for the new CARTO platform are already available on our [Sign up page](http://www.carto.com/signup). We also welcome all of our existing enterprise customers to contact us so we can provision them an account to the new platform for the reminder of their subscription term.

##### What happens to my current CARTO subscription? Will I have to pay extra to access the new platform?
If you are an existing CARTO Enterprise customer, we will give you an account to the new version of our platform without any additional cost for the reminder of your subscription term. Please get in touch with your CARTO representative or our Support team and we will provision you an enterprise account to the new platform according to your subscription plan.

##### Can I login to both versions of the CARTO platform with the same credentials?
No, the two platforms are completely independent, and hence they require their own set of credentials to login. In our login page users can select which version of CARTO they want to access. To access your old account, select “CARTO Dashboard”. 

##### Will all my data in the previous platform be readily available when I access the new version of CARTO?
No, by default it is not. Both versions of the platform are completely independent. Get in touch with your CARTO representative or our Support team, and we can assist you to migrate your datasets across our two platform versions.  

##### Will I be forced to move all my data to the new version of the CARTO platform?
No, you won’t. If you are an existing CARTO customer you can enjoy both versions of the platform. If you are an existing enterprise customer, and you would like to make available in the new platform some of the tables you have in your existing account, please get in touch with your CARTO representative or our Support team, and we can assist you to migrate data across our two platform versions.  

##### Is CARTO’s Student Package still available?
Yes, it is. Until March 2022 you can still sign up to our previous version of the platform as well as to the new one. From March 2022 onwards, Student accounts will only be available for our new platform. Therefore, please make sure you adapt the contents of your course or project to the new CARTO platform.

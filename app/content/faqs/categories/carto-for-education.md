##### What is the process for getting a CARTO Student account? 

To verify that only eligible students are accessing CARTO, we take advantage of Github‚Äôs verification system. This means you will need to go through their channels to ensure you receive the proper student account:

##### I am an educator and my course materials use the previous version of CARTO. What can I do?

First of all, thank you for using CARTO to unlock the potential of geospatial analysis with your students. We believe the new version of CARTO will carve out a new path for cloud native Location Intelligence for the years to come ‚Äî Happy to have you onboard!

To update your teaching materials to reflect the new version of CARTO, we recommend you follow these simple steps.  As an example, if your course content consisted of 5 datasets and 10 maps, updating content to the new CARTO platform shouldn‚Äôt take longer than a couple of hours.

1. First, access your previous CARTO account: https://carto.com/login
2. Open the dataset(s) you need and export them in CSV format. More info [here](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/export-data-guide/).
3. Use your new credentials to access your CARTO account: https://app.carto.com
4. Import the .CSV datasets you have exported
    - If you don't have a data warehouse, you can use the CARTO Data Warehouse provided by us
    - Follow our detailed guide for importing [here](/carto-user-manual/data-explorer/importing-data/)
5. Finally, using our new Builder tool, recreate the maps you‚Äôll need for your course content.

We appreciate these updates require some time and effort on your side, but rest assured, we won‚Äôt be limiting access to your previous CARTO account any time soon.

{{% bannerNote title="If you're in a rush" type="warning" %}}
For this semester: don't panic! Students can still sign up for the previous version of CARTO using the student pack until April 30th 2022. They just need to follow this link: https://carto.com/student-pack/signup/?plan=student-engine

From May 1st onwards, the signup process will be closed, but existing student and educator accounts will remain active. You can continue to use them for this semester, giving you time to update your materials for the next academic year.

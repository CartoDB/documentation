The CARTO Analytics Toolbox for Databricks ....

There are two types of modules: _core_ modules, that are [open source](https://github.com/CartoDB/analytics-toolbox-databricks), and _advanced_ modules, only available with a CARTO account. 

The Analytics Toolbox is distributed as a JAR package, available and ready to be installed in your Databricks cluster directly from the Maven repository. See the [installation instructions](../installation) to get started.

Visit the [SQL Reference](../../sql-reference/overview) to see the full list of available functions.
